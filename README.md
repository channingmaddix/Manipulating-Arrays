Manipulating Arrays holds methods for manipulating arrays in the following ways:

ArrayMean:
Doesn't manipulate the array, just finds the average of its integers and returns the average as a double.

ReverseArray:
Reverses an array given as a parameter by iterating from the last element to the first, 
mapping each one to a new array in the opposite order.

RotateArray:
Rotates an array any given number of spaces, left or right, with for loops.

SortArray:
Sorts an array by iterating through it, finding the index of the minimum value and 
moving it to the beginning of the search area, pushing the search area to the right, with each iteration.
